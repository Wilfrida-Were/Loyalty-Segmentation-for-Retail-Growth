# Loyalty Segmentation for Retail Growth

## Project Goal: Segment, Quantify, and Act on Customer Loyalty

This project helps **retail founders, operators, and analysts** turn raw customer data into **loyalty intelligence** revealing who their most loyal customers are, how they behave, and how to retain them with precision.

Retailers collect vast data through loyalty programs, digital platforms, and point-of-sale systems. But most lack visibility. They treat all customers the same, send generic offers, and miss the signals that drive repeat revenue.

A founder put it simply:

> “We collect customer data, but we don’t know who our loyal customers are or how to keep them.”
